    "text": "Welcome to my test website! I am currently playing around with learning Quarto to create my own personal website.\n\n\n\n\n\nKathryn T. Luk, LGSW, MSW (she/her) is a doctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work. She received an MSW from the University of Pittsburgh’s joint MSW/PhD program and a BS in Neuroscience with a minor in Public Health from the University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences. Her scholarship employs trauma-informed and recovery-oriented lenses to examine service user outcomes associated with experiencing compulsion and coercion within the mental healthcare system. Her dissertation, Interrupting Iatrogenics: Exploring Factors Associated with Mobile Crisis Workers’ Decisions to Deploy Coercive Interventions, will use random forest analysis, mixture modeling, and structural equation modeling to analyze characteristics of mobile crisis workers who are more likely to deploy coercive interventions when responding to a behavioral health crisis.\nInformed by her personal and professional experiences working with victim/survivors of gender-based violence accessing the mental healthcare system, Kathryn’s long-term goals are to continually evaluate and implemented the integrating trauma-informed care and recovery-oriented services into behavioral health systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     kal244@pitt.edu\n  \n  \n     View CV"
