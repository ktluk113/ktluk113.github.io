Kathryn T. Luk, LGSW, MSW (she/her) is a doctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work. She received an MSW from the University of Pittsburgh’s joint MSW/PhD program and a BS in Neuroscience with a minor in Public Health from the University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences. Her scholarship employs trauma-informed and recovery-oriented lenses to examine service user outcomes associated with experiencing compulsion and coercion within the mental healthcare system. Her dissertation, *Interrupting Iatrogenics: Exploring Factors Associated with Mobile Crisis Workers' Decisions to Deploy Coercive Interventions*, will use random forest analysis, mixture modeling, and structural equation modeling to analyze characteristics of mobile crisis workers who are more likely to deploy coercive interventions when responding to a behavioral health crisis.

Informed by her personal and professional experiences working with victim/survivors of gender-based violence accessing the mental healthcare system, Kathryn’s long-term goals are to continually evaluate and implemented the integrating trauma-informed care and recovery-oriented services into behavioral health systems.
