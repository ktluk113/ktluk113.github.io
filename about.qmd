---

Kathryn grew up in Stillwater, MN and attended the University of Minnesota Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences in Minneapolis, MN for Neuroscience. After realizing that pursuing medical school was not for her, she worked in domestic violence/sexual assault/sex trafficking advocacy for five years before returning to school to pursue her joint MSW/PhD in Social Work from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020.

Presently, Kathryn lives in St. Paul, MN with her corgi-Rottweiler rescue pup, Jack Jack. When not working on her dissertation she enjoys dancing, collecting stationery, growing houseplants, drinking semi-fancy teas, and playing board games.
